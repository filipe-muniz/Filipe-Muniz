I'm a Computer Science graduate from Brazil with experience in full-stack development, primarily working with React.js and Java. During college, I was part of a research team exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) for sentiment analysis in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Currently, I work in networking and infrastructure, and I have a strong curiosity for cloud computing and distributed systems.
